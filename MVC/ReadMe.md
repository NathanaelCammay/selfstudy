# Full-Stack .NET MVC Web Application Tutorial

Welcome to the **Full-Stack .NET MVC Tutorial**! This project guides you through building a modern web application from scratch using the **ASP.NET Core MVC** framework, integrating services, and incorporating external libraries like **Chart.js** for dynamic data visualizations. Follow along with the tutorial by ‪[@codeafuture](https://youtube.com/@codeafuture)‬ to master full-stack development with .NET!

## Project Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to:
- Build a full-stack web application using **ASP.NET Core MVC**.
- Implement the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern for clean code organization.
- Integrate **services** to handle business logic and data processing.
- Use **Chart.js** to create interactive and responsive charts for data visualization.
- Follow best practices for .NET development, including dependency injection and configuration.

By the end, you'll have a functional web application with a polished UI and dynamic data visualizations.

## Features
- **MVC Architecture**: Structured separation of concerns with Models, Views, and Controllers.
- **Service Integration**: Custom services for reusable business logic.
- **Chart.js Visualizations**: Interactive charts to display data dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap or custom CSS for a mobile-friendly UI.
- **Entity Framework Core** (optional): For database integration, if covered in the tutorial.
- **RESTful APIs** (optional): For fetching data to display in charts.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or later recommended)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C# extensions
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) (for managing Chart.js and other front-end dependencies)
- Basic knowledge of:
  - C# and .NET Core
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - MVC concepts

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotnet-mvc-tutorial.git
   cd dotnet-mvc-tutorial
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to restore .NET packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Install Chart.js**:
   Use npm to install Chart.js for front-end visualizations:
   ```bash
   npm install chart.js
   ```
   Alternatively, include Chart.js via CDN in your views (see [Integrating Chart.js](#integrating-chartjs)).

4. **Set Up Configuration**:
   - Update `appsettings.json` for any database connections or API keys (if applicable).
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
         "DefaultConnection": "YourConnectionStringHere"
       }
     }
     ```

## Running the Application
1. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   The app will be hosted at `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Open your browser and navigate to the above URL to see the application in action.

## Integrating Chart.js
To add Chart.js to your project:
1. Include Chart.js in your view via CDN:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
   ```
2. Create a canvas element in your Razor view:
   ```html
   <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
   ```
3. Add JavaScript to render a chart:
   ```html
   <script>
       const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
       new Chart(ctx, {
           type: 'bar',
           data: {
               labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow'],
               datasets: [{
                   label: 'Sample Data',
                   data: [12, 19, 3],
                   backgroundColor: ['#ff6384', '#36a2eb', '#ffce56']
               }]
           }
       });
   </script>
   ```
4. Fetch dynamic data from your controller or API to populate the chart (covered in the tutorial).
