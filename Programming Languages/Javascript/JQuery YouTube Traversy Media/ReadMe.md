### Syntax:

** $(selector).action() **

- Always start the query with a dollar sign to indicate jQuery
- the selector argument should be inside quotes
- the action methods are jQuery methods that perform actions on the selected element

##### Selectors:

- selecting an id element is done using a # ('h1#')
- selecting a class element is done using a . ('h1.')
- selecting via type is done by prefixing the selector argument with a : (:'text')
