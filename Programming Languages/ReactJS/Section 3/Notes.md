### Jonas knoweldge nuggets:

**What are the problems with vanilla javascript?**

- Front end apps are for handling data received from the server and used in the interface
- UI needs to stay in sync with data (_complex_ issue to solve)
- Interconnection of pieces of state becomes very complex hence a framework is needed
- State is often stored in the DOM, therefore many parts of app access direct source of data directly, causing bugs

Why do front-end frameworks exist?

- Keep a UI in sync with data is really hard, and these frameworks solve this issue, so that devs focus on the data and building the UI
- They enforce structure to code
- Frameworks give devs/teams a consistent way of developing web apps (consistent code base and product)
