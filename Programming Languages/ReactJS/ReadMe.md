## 📋 FAQ

**Q: How do I download the code?**  
_A_: Click the green **Code** button and select “Download ZIP”. Use starter files at each section start, final code for comparison :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

**Q: Stuck on a project?**  
_A_: Compare your code with the final version. Ensure library versions match. If still stuck, post on Udemy Q&A with your code snippet or sandbox :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.

**Q: Can I use the projects in my portfolio?**  
_A_: Yes! Just ensure you build them yourself and understand them fully—reusing the course's exact content is not allowed :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

**Q: Videos are blurry or won't load?**  
_A_: Try adjusting resolution (e.g. to 720p); Udemy support can help if issues persist. Direct downloads are disabled to prevent piracy :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.

**Q: Is TypeScript covered?**  
_A_: No. This course uses JavaScript. You’ll want to learn TypeScript separately afterward :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.
